Current Electrical Engineering PhD student at the University of Washington in Seattle. Research Assistant in the Mobile Intelligence Lab working with Prof. [Shyam Gollakota](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gshyam/) in the Paul G. Allen School for Computer Science & Engineering.

My current research interests lie broadly in the areas of mobile systems, embedded systems, machine learning, audio & speech, and small-scale robotics. I am committed to exploring innovative intersections among these fields to drive impactful advancements.

I received my bachelor's in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the American University of Beirut while working with Prof. [Joseph Costantine](https://www.aub.edu.lb/pages/profile.aspx?memberId=jc14) at the Electromagnetics Lab.
